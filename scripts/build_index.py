"""
Build the real ChromaDB indexes from data/: documents and audio
transcripts into text_index, images into image_index (Chapter 12 added
the last two — before that, this script indexed data/documents/ only).

Run with:  python scripts/build_index.py

Safe to re-run any time data/documents/ changes: index_documents_directory()
writes via ChromaDB's upsert (add-or-replace-by-id — see vector_store.py's
add_chunks() docstring for why plain add() was tried first and rejected),
so re-running this after editing a source file correctly refreshes that
file's chunks in place rather than either erroring or silently keeping
stale content. A NEW file just adds new chunks. Deleting chroma_db/ first
is only needed for a genuinely from-scratch rebuild (e.g. after changing
CHUNK_SIZE_WORDS, which changes every chunk_id's page-relative numbering, or
the HNSW settings, which apply only when a collection is created).

Re-running keeps the index in step with the files: a file that now yields
fewer chunks has its stale ones removed, and chunks of deleted files are
pruned (vector_store.replace_source_chunks / prune_missing_sources).
