Does RAGNova work with no network, as far as that can be checked without the UI?

Run with:  python scripts/verify_offline.py                  (no offline settings)
           python scripts/verify_offline.py --hf-offline     (HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1, TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 by hand)
           python scripts/verify_offline.py --offline-switch (RAGNOVA_OFFLINE=1, the project's own switch)
(needs `ollama serve` on this machine; the models must already be downloaded)

Methodology section 8.5 asks for the real test: switch the network adapter
off, then ingest a new file, answer a text query, answer an image query,
transcribe and answer a spoken query, and render citations. Switching an
adapter off is a system change this script will not make. Instead it installs
a guard inside the Python process (NetworkGuard below): every attempt to
reach anything but this machine (DNS lookups and connections to other
addresses) fails the way a dead network would, and is recorded. Talking to
the local Ollama server on 127.0.0.1 is allowed, since that is not the
network. Then it runs the checklist's steps through the same functions the
UI calls (src/ui/backend.py, src/pipelines/rag, src/ui/citations.py).

What this proves and what it does not: it proves no step of the checklist
*needs* the network, and shows every attempt that was made. It does not
replace the real run (adapter off, through the Streamlit page); that one
waits for the wired UI. The guard only sees Python's own sockets, so a
native library opening its own connection would escape it.
