Write images into ChromaDB's image_index — the write path Chapter 10 noted
was missing ("image_index has no write path into ChromaDB yet").

Chapter 8's ImageIngestionPipeline already does the hard work (load, OCR,
CLIP-embed) but stores results in an in-memory ChunkStore that disappears
when the process ends. This module is the Chapter 12 integration glue:
run that pipeline, then hand its chunks to the same add_chunks() the text
side uses (src/core/vector_store.py), into the image collection.

       documents. Made relative to the project root here, the same way.

       spaces. normalize_text() is the shared cleanup Chapter 6 made for
